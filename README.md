# Deep-CNN-for-Modulation-Classification

## File Description

1. `RadioML 2016.10a (i)-(iii).zip` provides the dataset in MATLAB version, in which (i) contains BPSK, AM-SSB, AM-DSB, and 8PSK; (ii) contains QAM16, PAM4, GFSK, and CPFSK; (iii) contains WBFM, QPSK, and QAM64.
2. The `convolution kernes at 1st and 4th layers` gives all the visualized convolution kernels.
3. The `deep CNN.mat` is the covergent deep CNN model trained with proposed data augmentation method.
4. The `test.m` is used to evaluate the performance of deep CNN and should be run in MATLAB 2019a.

P.S. The manuscript has been submitted to the *Neural Computing and Applications*, and full source code will be released after the paper has been accepted.
