# Deep-CNN-for-Modulation-Classification

## File Description

1. `RadioML 2016.10a (i)-(iii).zip` provides the dataset in MATLAB version.
2. The `convolution kernes at 1st and 4th layers` gives all the visualized convolution kernels.
3. The `deep CNN.mat` is the covergent deep CNN model trained with proposed data augmentation.
4. The `test.m` is used to evaluate the performance of deep CNN and should be run in MATLAB 2019a.

P.s. The manuscript has been submitted to the *Multidimensional Systems and Signal Processing*, and complete code will be published after the paper has been accepted.
